Sprint week 3 was overall an incredibly productive week. I believe my team keeps progressing and communicating at an increasing rate. We do make more mistakes than most other groups however, I think this is to be expected because we are the only team with only new co-hort members. A big goal this week was getting organized with our previous code cleaning it up and ensuring that it was readable. Dandy and Brennan handled that and they did a great job, I was also scrum master this week so I was the one reading over the code and approving the pull requests on git hub. Ayanna and Adam were both in charge of creating the HTML page and the grid system. They both did an amazing job and its amazing to see how the front end looks. 

## What I DID!!!!

First off, I loved being the scrum master. I think I have always enjoyed project management and communicating with everyone. It was great talking with everyone on their code and understanding the project as a whole is really insightful. Creating specific users issues and creating documentation was really awesome. I was also tasked with getting started on the SQL. Most of my week was consumed by research and using code academy to get a base understanding. I also worked with Roberto to help with what would work with electra. I created an erd diagram to get a nice structure of how the db will look. Rob gave me great insight on how to store images. It was a learning experience. I would have loved to have an actual db to show however, the scope would have been too large.
